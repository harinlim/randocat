# Random Cats

Deployed at: <https://harinlim.github.io/randocat/>

## About

This is a simple client-side web application that makes use of two 3rd party APIs to show off my love for cats via random cats and cat facts on demand.

APIs used:

- [CataaS](https://cataas.com): Public API for cat pictures and gifs.
- [MeowFacts](https://github.com/wh-iterabb-it/meowfacts): Simple API that returns random cat facts via `GET` requests.
